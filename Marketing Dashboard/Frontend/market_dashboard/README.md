# Project Name

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository-name
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
3. Run the Development Server
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
This will start the server at http://localhost:3000.

4. Open the Project
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to view the result. The page will auto-update as you edit the files.

5. Modifying the Project
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js or any other component within the app directory.

Building the Project
To build the project for production, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
This will generate an optimized production build in the .next folder. Once built, you can start the project in production mode using:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
API Configuration
In order for your project to connect to the backend, you'll need to update the API base URL. Locate the api.js file and update the API_BASE variable with the appropriate URL where your backend is running.

javascript
Copy code
const API_BASE = "http://localhost:8443/api/Campaign"; // Update this URL as per your backend's address
Make sure to replace the URL with the actual backend endpoint you're using, whether it's a local or remote server.

Download Required Files
If there are any additional files that need to be downloaded, you can either provide a link or include them within the project directory. For example:

Configuration Files: Download the required configuration files from [link-to-files].
Assets: Download assets (e.g., images, fonts) from [link-to-assets].
Place these files in the respective folders within the project (e.g., /public or /assets).

Common Issues and Solutions
Here are some common issues that may arise during development and their solutions:

Issue 1: Port Already in Use
If you see an error indicating that port 3000 is already in use, you can change the port by running the development server with a different port:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev -- --port 3001
This will start the server on port 3001.

Issue 2: Missing Dependencies
If you encounter missing dependencies, make sure to run the following command to install all necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
Issue 3: Backend Not Found
If your frontend can't connect to the backend, ensure that:

The backend is running and accessible at the correct URL.
You have updated the API_BASE variable in api.js with the correct backend URL.
There are no issues with CORS that could block the connection.
